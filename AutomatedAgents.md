# AI Agent for Automating Business Process

## This post is about how the Automated agents are evolving. 

GenAI is about generating next token from a trained context and sometime it can hallucinate. Slowly learned how to control the generation of next token in a way needed for specific purpose and extended with additional knowledge for the AI model. This resulted in generating more usable code through AI models. And also the accuracy of image recognition and interpretation of texts from image is really helpful in making decisions by the AI models.
The next stage of evolution is once confidently able to generate the next token in a way needed for specific purpose then use that to generate instructions to run them automatically.
